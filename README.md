## Usage 🚀

Once select `Load unpacked`, then what follows is you just go to your converted design project, Example mine is at `https://app.dhiwise.com/design-converter/application/xxxxxxxxx?screenExportBuild=2&screenIds=0` in your browser. Now you can click the `Dhiwise Code Copy`. and Activate it.

After enabling the toggle, you will find the copy button in the left pannel. Sometimes the `Copy` button may not appear, this happens when `dhiwise` website has not loaded fully on your machine, in this case you can refresh the site, and then turn on the extension again.
